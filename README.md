3. Add the desired libs/apps include paths, in the correct/dpendency order: GCC C++ Compiler -> Includes -> Include paths (-l) -> Add.. (+ green button)

Itâ€™s recomended to use static compilation: GCC C++ Linker -> Miscellaneous -> Linker flags   -static
6. Add or link sourse code folder of desired libs/apps: Project -> Properties -> C/C++ General -> Path and Symbols -> Source Location -> [Add Folder..]/[Link Folder..]
